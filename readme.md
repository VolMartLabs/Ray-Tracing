# Ray Tracing
Implementation of ray tracing algorithm using C++ programming language. It renders images in .ppm format.
In current version of the algorithm you have to use command console to get the picture.
Use ``%PathToExecutable%\Ray Tracing.exe > %ImageName%.ppm``. Personally I use Photoshop CS5 to view the pictures, but you can use whatever you want.
